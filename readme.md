## Introduction

eFootball is a popular football simulation video game that features a wide range of football players, each with their own unique set of attributes. This project focuses on predicting a player's overall rating in the game using machine learning techniques.

# Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model can be found at [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gPMdbOqxFe7HrcwyYHQNXnXJ-SzyswE_?usp=sharing]. This dataset consists of player feature data, including attributes such as height, Offensive awareness, and other relevant characteristics.

## Installation

To set up the environment for this project, you'll need Python and several libraries. You can create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies using the following commands:
Clone the repository
git clone - (https://github.com/bajajku/Efootball_Regression_Project.git)
cd Efootball_Regression_Project 

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies
pip install -r requirementss.txt

## Usage

Once you have installed the required dependencies, you can use the model for cancer classification. Here are the steps to follow:

 1) Data Preparation: Ensure you have access to the dataset, and the data is preprocessed appropriately. This may include cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.

 2) Training the Model: Train the ANN model using the provided dataset or your custom dataset. See the Training section for details on how to train the model.

 3) Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and other relevant metrics (see Evaluation).

## Model Architecture

The architecture of the Artificial Neural Network used for efootball regression consists of several layers, including input, hidden, and output layers. The exact architecture may vary depending on the dataset and problem complexity. A typical architecture includes:

  1)Input Layer: Accepts the cell feature data as input.
  2)Hidden Layers: One or more hidden layers with multiple neurons to extract patterns and features.
  3)Output Layer: Provides the final output of players overall rating based on desired position.

The activation functions, optimizer, and loss function are selected based on the problem requirements.
## Training

Training the model involves the following steps:

  1.Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset by cleaning, normalizing, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

  2.Model Configuration: Define the ANN architecture, including the number of layers and neurons, activation functions, and other hyperparameters.

  5.Model Training: Train the model using the training dataset. Monitor the loss and accuracy during training.

  4.Model Saving: Save the trained model for later use.

For detailed code and instructions on training the model, refer to the documentation or code files in the repository.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model's performance, use a separate testing dataset. Common evaluation metrics for binary classification tasks like this one include accuracy, precision,mean squared error. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify benign and malignant cells.

##Deployment

Deploying the model for real-world use involves integrating it into a production environment. This can be done through various methods, including web applications, APIs, or mobile applications. Ensure that the model is accessible and can provide predictions on new cell samples efficiently.
