# eFootball Regression Project

This repository contains a machine learning regression project that aims to predict a player's overall rating in the eFootball video game based on their in-game statistics and position. The project extracts data from the PES Database (PESDB) to create a dataset and then builds machine learning regression models for prediction.


## Introduction

eFootball is a popular football simulation video game that features a wide range of football players, each with their own unique set of attributes. This project focuses on predicting a player's overall rating in the game using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

- **Data Collection**: The project involves scraping player data from the PESDB website using web scraping techniques or utilizing available APIs.

- **Data Preprocessing**: The collected data is cleaned, transformed, and processed to create a suitable dataset for model training and evaluation.

- **Feature Engineering**: Feature engineering is performed to select relevant attributes and possibly create new features that might improve the model's performance.

- **Model Building**: Several regression models are built to predict a player's overall rating based on their attributes and position. Common regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression may be employed.

- **Model Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) to assess their accuracy and performance.

- **Deployment**: If desired, you can deploy the best-performing model to make predictions in real-time.
